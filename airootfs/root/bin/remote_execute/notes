if gnupg --sign decides to actually encrypt with the private key rather than create shit loads of sign bloat and leave it clear text
then this would be good copy the public key get remote knock access and execute

but it doesnt requires

server gnupg key for the user allowing remote access
client gnupg key for the remote user requesting remote access

both need to exchange keys server needs to encrypt for that user 

could probably add an ip database to attempt some form of multiuser using nc 2>/
but /shrug
