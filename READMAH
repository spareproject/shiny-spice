got bored wanted to see if tor bridge worked went on 2 tor enabled irc's using weechat from an nspawn container
took about 15 minutes? before host was making network connections out so lulz at that 

tried grsec kernel systemd-networkd doesnt work on boot because suid? then creating a bridge interface deleting it then restarting systemd-nspawn works? 
didnt really get that so back to the normal one 

chromium makes my computer sound like its trying to take off or more specifically g+ and gdrive 
so going icecat probably dump a better iso with more foo on it

wifi is a total pain should probably dump wifi-menu and dhcpcd on it but i havent used a laptop since linuxcon
currently need to wpa_supplicant / wpa_cli to get anything up then manually set ip address so bit shit

but this has far to little on it to be usefull 

went root owned sshd wasted loads of time deleted loads of stuff booted a nspawn container with drop caps... and poof sshd as root needs chown 
so back to none root sshd 

going to make scripts to cryptsetup /dev/sda 
if butterface gets "stable" raid5 then ill probably go butterface for internal storage 
currently just doing cryptsetup on /dev/sdXY and  mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/sdXY

/dev/sda cryptsetup + some form of pluggable gnupg + gpg-agent usb : / 
/mnt/keys/key0.gpg
/mnt/rawfs/storage.raw
^ but no idea how to merge that with unionfs and containers

basically dropping everything to make a small easy to maintain stick and then transferable desktop in a raw image 
can tarball daily and dump it on whatever machine im on

kde5 works in nspawn
gnome sort of works in nspawn (sucks at resolution when headless)
dwm always works and never breaks 

container foo i uploaded was fugly and buggy still is :D 
probably the next thing to fix 

but its tidy enough to build up again
