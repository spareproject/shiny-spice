got bored wanted to see if tor bridge worked went on 2 tor enabled irc's using weechat from an nspawn container
took about 15 minutes? before host was making network connections out so lulz at that 

tried grsec kernel systemd-networkd doesnt work on boot because suid? then creating a bridge interface deleting it then restarting systemd-nspawn works? 
didnt really get that so back to the normal one 

chromium makes my computer sound like its trying to take off or more specifically g+ and gdrive 
so going icecat probably dump a better iso with more foo on it

wifi is a total pain should probably dump wifi-menu and dhcpcd on it but i havent used a laptop since linuxcon
currently need to wpa_supplicant / wpa_cli to get anything up then manually set ip address so bit shit

but this has far to little on it to be usefull 

went root owned sshd wasted loads of time deleted loads of stuff booted a nspawn container with drop caps... and poof sshd as root needs chown 
so back to none root sshd 

going to make scripts to cryptsetup /dev/sda 
if butterface gets "stable" raid5 then ill probably go butterface for internal storage 
currently just doing cryptsetup on /dev/sdXY and  mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/sdXY

/dev/sda cryptsetup + some form of pluggable gnupg + gpg-agent usb : / 
/mnt/keys/key0.gpg
/mnt/rawfs/storage.raw
^ but no idea how to merge that with unionfs and containers

basically dropping everything to make a small easy to maintain stick and then transferable desktop in a raw image 
can tarball daily and dump it on whatever machine im on

kde5 works in nspawn
gnome sort of works in nspawn (sucks at resolution when headless)
dwm always works and never breaks 

container foo i uploaded was fugly and buggy still is :D 
probably the next thing to fix 

but its tidy enough to build up again

#Steam on a stick
erm yeh wont boot if /dev/sda isnt a ext4 formatted device change fstab 
stuck .bash_profile executes on tty2 to bind mount the stuff steam updates into the user config blargh blargh etc etc
has pepper flash and chromium although im pretty sure that bbc iplayer is an attack site because everything else works
watch that shit for 2 minutes and poof the entire liveusb goes down 
interstellarer marines and some other random games need ttf-ms-fonts to work so thats in it
could probably dump controller support at some point
but easy working catalyst driver install on a stick 
although i could never get dual card monitor output to work and everytime i used the actual interface it was set the right config reboot then the gui refused to boot afterwards 
but it does work and you can actually see the updates in games definitly getting better pretty fun


these are all totally volatile going to leave this repo add a new config mv the current to old and only store two at a time

i always bump an html bookmarks folder in root with whatever random .onion sites i can find the last time only like 2 of them stayed up haha
but the forums are always good to read and tend to stay up : / should have updated it but didnt torsearch and torch dont really find anything usefull 
normally scrape forum posts for random links
