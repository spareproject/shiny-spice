right so that was annoying like 400 lines of pointless input checks with error messages and im pretty sure its not idiot proof



soooooooo... havent even finished it and more updates

dropping unionfs-fuse dumping mount -t overlayfs...  install scripts on none booted
dropping unionfs-fuse using systemd-nspawn --overlayfs boots (couldnt use ssh on 220 so not yet)

really want to setup btrfs 

--private-users switch do what i think it does? 

meh either way tried dumping 220 onto a liveusb and it hangs 10seconds on boot with udev clean up 

and it wont ssh into anything because of failed to allocate PTY0 and other random fails 

been running testing for ages and this is the first time its not been perfect so /shrug should have probably poked it more but need sleep
