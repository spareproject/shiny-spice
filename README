new plan...

when i can be bothered to write it...

so random notes

nspawn raw -r rootfs -s "not the correct format" 
^ isnt atomic makes changes to the filesystem fallocate command fails but the script continues 

gradually fixing the all around fail as and when i try to execute something and it breaks
